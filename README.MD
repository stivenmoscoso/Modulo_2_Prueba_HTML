## 💡  Technical Decisions
What is sought with this project is to replicate a web page using the concepts learned in RIWI about HTML and CSS

### 1. Estructura HTML
An HTML document must be well formed so that the browser can read it correctly. To do this, you must have a well-defined initial structure, with certain mandatory HTML tags and some recommended features. 


### 2. Estructura CSS
The basic structure of CSS is based on rules that apply to specific HTML elements, composed of a selector and a block of statements enclosed in braces.
 Each rule follows the general syntax.

### 3. Imágenes Responsive:
Utility classes are used to ensure that illustrations fit the container.
